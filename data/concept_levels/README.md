The `MulDiPNet/data/concept_levels` folder contains three files:
- `concepts_subordinate-level_ILSVRC1000.txt` : It contains the set of 1000 categories from the subordinate-level of ILSVRC 
- `concepts_basic-level_ILSVRC1000.txt` : It contains the set of 682 categories from the basic-level of ILSVRC
- `association_synsets_subordinate-level_to_synsets_basic-level_ILSVRC1000.txt` : It contains the association of the 1000 subordinate-categories of ILSVRC (first column of the file) with the 682 basic-level categories of ILSVRC (second column of the file). Note that, in the second column, when the synset-id is printed, it means that no basic-level exist (and it is actually an entry-level category).
